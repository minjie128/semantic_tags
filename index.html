      <h3>Shanghai Sightseeing and Attractions</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>The Bund</dt>
        <dd>Shanghai's picturesque waterfront, known as "the Bund," is where you'll find those classic skyline photo ops. With the <em>Oriental Pearl TV Tower</em>, the <em>Shanghai World Financial Center</em> and other skyscrapers standing across the Huangpu River, the view (on a clear day) stuns. And behind you, gorgeous European-style buildings housing restaurants and shops (<em>Nanjing Road</em> is just around the corner) line the waterfront boulevard, affording plenty of activities.</dd>
        <dt>Shanghai Museum</dt>
        <dd>Located on the People's Square near <em>Nanjing Road</em>, the Shanghai Museum is hard to miss thanks to its distinct architecture (a circular building atop a square foundation) and remarkable size. And you really shouldn't skip this historical gem. Frequently called one of the best museums in China, this expansive museum houses a diverse collection of artifacts (more than 1,000,000 to be exact) that chart the nation's history. Highlights include ornate calligraphy, exquisite jade carvings, thousand-year-old bronze works and traditional Chinese garb. For more information, check out the Shanghai Museum's <a href="http://www.shanghaimuseum.net/en/index.jsp" target="_blank">website</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Yuyuan Garden</dt>
        <dd>Dating back to the 16th century, the 5-acre Yuyuan Garden is the city's most revered green space. The garden took nearly 20 years to completely construct and was initially intended to be the private garden for Ming-dynasty official Pan Yunduan and his family. However, the garden ended up taking some hits, enduring both British occupation during the Opium Wars and again by the French during the Taiping Rebellion. Despite the turmoil, the garden remained largely intact and is today a beautiful retreat loved by many.</dd>
        <dt>Jade Buddha Temple</dt>
        <dd>One of the city's most popular attractions, the Jade Buddha Temple impresses visitors with its legion of statues. The temple was originally built to house two jade statues brought in from Burma. But over time, its collection of ornate statues grew, subsequently drawing crowds in droves. While you should definitely pay homage to the jade buddhas, there are other figures that merit your attention. In the Grand Hall, three golden Buddhas represent the incarnations of Buddha (past, present and future), while the Heavenly King Hall features four heavenly kings surrounding more buddhas, acting as divine protectors.</dd>

      <h3>Food and Drink</h3>
      <li>Yang’s Fry Dumplings</li>
        <p>The city’s most famous place for sesame-seed-and-scallion-coated shēngjiān (fried dumplings) gets nil points for decor or service, but queues can stretch to the horizon as eager diners wait for scalding shēngjiān to be dished into mustard-coloured bowls.</p>

      <li>Hǎi Dǐ Lāo</li>
        <p>This Sichuanese hotpot restaurant is all about service, and the assault begins the minute you walk in the door. Predining options include complimentary shoe shines, manicures and trays of fresh fruit; once you’ve actually sat down, the buzz of activity continues with the donning of matching red aprons and a YouTube-worthy noodle-stretching dance performance (order lāo miàn).</p>

          “From the architectural landmarks lining the Bund and the rickety charm of the Old Town to the leafy backstreets of the former French Concession, Shànghǎi is a city that just begs for wandering.

I love that you can slurp a bowl of hand-pulled noodles or bite into soupy xiǎolóngbāo dumplings for next-to-nothing, then splurge on cocktails and fusion fare gazing out from a rooftop bar on the Bund over the...”
